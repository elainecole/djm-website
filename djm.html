                            My name is Debby Meredith. In 2003, after over two decades of being an entrepreneur,
                            general manager, and venture capitalist, I began working on my own helping various
                            companies to establish or enhance their development organizations. I've often taken on
                            interim executive roles working directly with company founders, helping to assemble world-class
                            teams, architecture software products, and establish an initial roadmap for operational
                            success. It's been extremely rewarding for me to work with high caliber teams of committed
                            entrepreneurs and hopefully helpful to the companies as well. In addition to my consulting,
                            board, and advisory work, I'm currently a <a href="http://www.iconventures.com/team/">venture
                                partner</a> with Icon Ventures. <a href="http://www.iconventures.com">Icon Ventures</a>
